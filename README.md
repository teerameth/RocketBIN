## Description

Space Monster Hunter is an exciting game built using Unity Engine where players use a combination of physical and on-screen buttons to configure a 10-digit binary number. The goal is to match this binary number to the specific (base 10) number displayed on the screen, aiming to destroy space monsters.

During gameplay, the aiming sight of the space weapon reacts dynamically to the configured binary number. As the player gets closer to the target value, the aiming sight gradually approaches the space monster. Conversely, if the configured number is far from the target, the aiming sight swings around the space monster with a higher radius.

Upon successfully matching the binary number to the target, the space weapon is launched automatically, destroying the space monster. Be prepared for new types of monsters to appear as the game progresses!

## Features

- Binary input configuration using physical and on-screen buttons.
- Dynamic aiming sight that reacts to the configured binary number.
- Progressive difficulty with new types of monsters appearing upon successful destruction.
